# Operating-System-assignment
My assignment and code for OS
this code was made to solve the producer consumer problem 
where a  producer needs to generate items and put it into a table
using the lines
$ gcc producer.c -pthread -lrt -o producer
$ gcc producer.c -pthread -lrt -o producer
$ ./producer & ./consumer &
 should commit the code
I have many bugs in the code and was not able to correctly figure out what we needed to do
After consulting  with other students we had very similar code and we could not get any help from some of the tutors unfortunately
Hopefully what I have submitted would work somewhat better on your end then mine.
